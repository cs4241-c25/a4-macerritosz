Hosting Link: http://34.226.142.114:3000

Flight Itinerary tracker: keep all your flights all in one place!
For this project I made sure to use the React framework to break up my project into components, the tailwindCSS
framework for styling, and express.js for the backend. 

## Additions & Changes
1. More reliable add/delete/modify
2. Increased accuracy of table display when data was modified
3. Used GitHub passport strategy to allow for login with github and for that info to be passed into Context for rest of APP
4. Included appropriate error messages for invalid login/signup
5. Better validated signup so that usernames are unique, not username-password combination
6. Formatted and styled content better
7. Better routed between pages so that its impossible to be in '/' without being logged in 
8. Used environment variables so sensitive info is kept safe
